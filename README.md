# Car-Analysis-Project
DS 3021 Final Project

In this project, we aim to develop and evaluate a regression-based machine learning model that accurately predicts the price of used Ford vehicles. Used car pricing is influenced by a wide range of factors, including mileage, model, year, and color. Accurately modeling these relationships can be challenging but is valuable for both buyers and sellers.

An effective price prediction model has several practical applications. For consumers, it can offer guidance on whether a listing is fairly priced or not. For sellers and dealerships, it can assist in setting competitive, data-backed prices that reflect market trends.

Our work focuses specifically on Ford vehicles to narrow the scope of the problem and better control for brand-specific pricing patterns. By training and testing regression models on real-world data using the ML techniques we've learned throughout the semester, we hope to gain insights into which features most strongly affect vehicle price and how machine learning can be leveraged in the automotive market.
